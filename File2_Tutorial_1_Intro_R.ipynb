To run them here, click the **Connect** button in the upper-right section of the page.  When you encounter a Jupyter cell with an R script, click the black circle with arrow button to run the code. You are encouraged to investigate options and learn further by editing the script; again click the black circle to run the cell. \n",

However, it is possible that your Anaconda release did not automatically include the R kernel for Jupyter.  You can tell whether it is present if the R logo (blue R in front of gray ellipse) is shown at the top-right of the Jupyter page.  If it is missing, then the code cells below will fail upon execution. To install the R kernel within Python, type: **conda install -c r r-irkernel**.  Alternatively, you can make R available to Jupyter from an R console by typing: **install.packages('IRkernel')  ;  IRkernel::installspec()**.  For further discussion of the relationship between Python, R, Jupyter and other notebook environments, see [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/jupyter-notebook-r). "

However, around 2012 a new compiler was implemented similar to the one underlying Python.  R and Python thus have roughly similar computational efficiency.  Both are slower than C, C++ and Fortran which are used in both environments for computationally heavy portions of an analysis. Many CRAN packages use C++ under the hood.  \n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to improved compilers, R has also been adapted for use in a multi-core environment, including GPUs.  Two capabilities are now in base-R (Rmpi and snow), but most are in several dozen CRAN packages; see the [CRAN Task View on High Performance and Parallel Computing with R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/HighPerformanceComputing.html).  \n",
        "\n",
        "Generally, R has not been viewed as a language appropriate for pipeline analysis of large datasets such as those emerging from astronomical satellites or observatories.  This criticism is valid in the sense that it does not have a large and growing software library of specialized code for astronomical data, such as the ~2000 CRAN packages in the _Bioconductor_ toolbox for genomics or the diverse packages in the _astropy_ project in Python.  \n",
        "\n",
        "However, R can be operated in batch mode, running scripts with the _Rscript_ (or with more flexibility, CRAN package _littler_) command line interface from the operating system prompt.  These commands can be embedded in parallelized scripts for supercomputers using PBS or related scripts.  Using Rscript, we at Penn State have reanalized the full dataset of major surveys from NASA satellites and ground-based observatories involving millions of input and output files.  The motivation for this approach is that the instrument-specific characteristics of the data reduction had already been performed in Python (e.g NASA Levels 2 and 3 data products), and the data were ready for advanced statistical analysis using CRAN packages.  In our case, sophisticated CRAN packages originally designed for econometrics and machine learning play a central role, along with a Fortran code we wrote for a computationally intensive step.  R code for astronomical pipelines can be remarkably brief if one effectively uses the tens-of-thousands of advanced functions available in CRAN.\n",
